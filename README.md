# Collaboration

	A Game Engine for C/C++ Game Development. The collaboration project is combination of many tools/modules into one ( Render, Sound, Script, Animation, Physics ) engines. The main aim is to make the process of creating games ( 2D/3D ) as easy as possible ( if possible 😂 ). Any **feedbacks** are strongly encouraged 👍. 

## To Do

- [ ] Creating a GUI for modifying an object ( example would be a sphere 🟠 )
- [ ] Creating a GUI for modifying a simple sound ( example would be 3️⃣ seconds of sine wave 〰️ )
- [ ] Creating a logger module ( For ⚠️ debugging/tracking purposes )
- [ ] Binding languages for scripting
- [ ] Integrating a libanimation library for creating animations 🎥
- [ ] Creating a Bug Report 🐛 ( For receiving feedbacks & bugs ) 
- [ ] Version Control of the project
- [ ] Displaying/Loading shader status ( file size, LoC, etc. )

## Build

Create a build directory and depending on the directory, use ```cmake -B.``` to build in the current directory and ```-S..``` option for the source CMakeLists.txt.
